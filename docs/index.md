# **T3CO** : Transportation Technology Total Cost of Ownership Tool

## Description

This repo houses T3CO (Transportation Technology Total Cost of Ownership), software for modeling total cost of ownership for commercial vehicles with advanced powertrains.

To start, go to the [Overview](https://github.com/NREL/T3CO/blob/1b7d677bb56a4f9a7d423b0d2532d56f371e2fc5/docs/T3CO_Overview.md)

## Usage
**T3CO** is a general framework allowing a user to determine the total cost of ownership (TCO) of a FASTSim vehicle (paired with a FASTSim DriveCycle(s) for determining fuel efficiency). The user can also determine performance of gradability, acceleration, and range. In addition to straight TCO computation there is also the option to optimize a vehicle powertrain such that it meets performance optional targets while also optionally minimizing TCO.
